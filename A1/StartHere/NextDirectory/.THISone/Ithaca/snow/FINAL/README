You made it!
You reached the final directory!
To complete this assignment you must run the script named "finalScript.sh" in this directory
and then submit the file it creates to CMS.

In order to run this script, you should be able to simply type in the following command at the prompt:

$ ./finalScript.sh

When the script runs, it will ask you for your NetID.   Please enter your NetID with no additional
spaces or characters.   When you hit RETURN, the script will echo your NetID back to you and ask
you if it is correct.   Make sure it is correct!    When correct, just type a 'y' when prompted
to verify that your NetID is correct.   At that point, a special file named:

CS2043-A1-SubmitThisFile.txt

will be created in your home directory.    You can use a "cd" command to return to your home
directory and then an "ls" command to verify that it is there.

It will be easiest for you to run Firefox in your virtualized environment to access CMS so that you can
submit the file directly from your virtualized environment.   If you don't, or if you are using
ugclinux you will need to transfer the file somewhere where you can access CMS to upload us.   If this is
the case for you, please come see us in office hours for more assistance.
