Welcome to Assignment #1
========================
To complete this assignment, remember to read the README file in each directory that you visit.

Then you will continue to use 'ls', 'cat' and 'cd' to navigate deeper into the filesystem
until you find the final task.   The README files you encounter along the way will tell you
what to do.

To begin with, simple go into the "NextDirectory"  (if that's confusing, just type the 'ls' command
now and look at the files/directories in this directory)

Good Luck!
